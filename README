Btcbawt node.js based IRC bot.

Reads out bitcoin price changes.
To see in action (or inaction) connect to efnet and join #bitcoin-market

To run one:
1. edit stdin2irc.js and change the network, channel, and nick to your liking.
2. touch keepRunning
3. run checkbot.sh (add this to crontab)

To stop:
1. delete keepRunning
2. kill processes spawned by checkbot.

TODO:
1. integrate changes to irc.js back to irc.node project where it came from.
2. stop depending on the location of irc.js being /home/btcbawt/irc.js
3. make killing the bot easier.
4. ?
